Crypt::Lite version 0.82.0x
===========================

Sometimes it's necessary to protect some certain data against plain reading
or you intend to send information through the Internet. Another reason might
be to assure users cannot modify their previously entered data in a follow-up
step of a long Web transaction where you don't want to deal with server-side
session data. The goal of Crypt::Lite was to have a pretty simple way to
encrypt and decrypt data without the need to install and compile huge
packages with lots of dependencies.

Crypt::Lite generates every time a different encrypted hash when you
re-encrypt the same data with the same secret string. Nevertheless you
are able to make double or tripple-encryption with any data to increase
the security. Decryption works also on hashes that have been encrypted
on a foreign host (try this with an unpatched IDEA installation ;-).
