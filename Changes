Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Lite.

0.82.07  16.09.2006 15:27

	 - There was a severe security bug in the encryption procedure in all
	   earlier releases. To include the private key was a bad idea.
	   It's being improved for the little price there is an additional
	   dependency to the MD5 Perl module from now on.

	 - Updated documentation part about double encryption.

	 - Strings encrypted with earlier versions can still be decrypted
	   with this release and the new procedure will apply as of the next
	   encryption call.


0.82.06  Thu Sep 29 10:33:00 2005

	 - A comment has shown it needs at least version 5.6.1
	   of Perl and the Makefile.PL has been updated
	   accordingly.


0.82.05  Wed Apr 14 00:58:00 2005
